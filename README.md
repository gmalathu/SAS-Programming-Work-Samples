# SAS-Programming-Work-Samples
SAS Base Code from professional experience demonstrating proficiency in the SAS Base Programming

This repository contains code I developed as a reporting analyst working in collections management and 
charge-offs finance domains. In this role I built scripts using SAS Base as the primary reporting tool
for scripting procedural SQL in addition to SAS-language specific methods.

It includes reporting on outbound dialing related compliance reporting as well as collections
and recovery management types of reporting which helped with understanding the effectiveness of various
campaigns and other collections & recovery related actions.
